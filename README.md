# Image-Caption-Ganerator-Custom-vs-Pre-Trained-CNN
Built a deep learning model to generate captions for images using CNN, LSTM, and attention mechanism. Compared custom and pre-trained CNNs for feature extraction.

# Developed a deep learning-based image captioning model that generates automatic textual descriptions for any input image. The system compares performance between custom-built CNNs and pre-trained CNNs for feature extraction, followed by LSTM for sequence generation. Integrated attention mechanisms enhance caption accuracy.

# Tools & Technologies:
TensorFlow, CNN, LSTM, Attention Mechanism, Jupyter Notebook.
